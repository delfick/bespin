Project Dormant
===============

This project was purpose built for a need at a previous workplace of mine.

As far as I could tell, that was the only place this was used and since my
departure from that workplace they have slowly switched to other projects for
their deployments.

I don't use AWS at my current workplace, or in any personal projects and so
haven't needed to use this.

In the future it's likely I'll only have time for small changes in this project.

Bespin
======

An opinionated wrapper around Amazon Cloudformation that reads yaml files.
and make things happen.

The documentation can be found at http://bespin.readthedocs.io

Installation
------------

Just use pip::

  pip install bespin

Usage
-----

Once bespin is installed, there will be a new program called ``bespin``.

When you call bespin without any arguments it will print out the tasks you
have available.

You may invoke these tasks with the ``task`` option.

Simpler Usage
-------------

To save typing ``--task``, ``--stack`` and ``--environment`` too much
, the first positional argument is treated as ``task``
(unless it is prefixed with a ``-``); the second positional argument
(if also not prefixed with a ``-``) is taken as the ``environment`` and the third is
treated as the ``stack``.

So::

    $ bespin --task deploy --environment dev --stack app

Is equivalent to::

    $ bespin deploy dev app

Logging colors
--------------

If you find the logging output doesn't look great on your terminal, you can
try setting the ``term_colors`` option in ``bespin.yml`` to either ``light`` or
``dark``.

The yaml configuration
----------------------

Bespin reads everything from a yaml configuration. By default this is a
``bespin.yml`` file in the current directory, but may be changed with the
``--bespin-config`` option or ``BESPIN_CONFIG`` environment variable.

It will also read from ``~/.bespin.yml`` and will be overridden by anything in
the configuration file you've specified.

Tests
-----

Install testing deps and run the helpful script::

  pip install -e .
  pip install -e ".[tests]"
  ./test.sh
